            ExpressVPN operates a vast network of 3,000+ servers spread across 160 locations in 105 countries, offering 
            excellent global coverage. It uses TrustedServer technology, which means all servers run on RAM-only
             infrastructure—no data is written to hard drives—ensuring every server reboot wipes all data. This greatly 
             enhances security and privacy. The service supports a range of protocols including Lightway (ExpressVPN’s fast 
             and lightweight proprietary protocol), OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPSec, and others. Lightway, in particular, is
              open-source, built for speed and reliability, and delivers faster connection times and lower battery
               consumption on mobile devices. ExpressVPN also offers obfuscated servers, helping users bypass
                censorship in restrictive regions like China or the UAE.

           ExpressVPN offers apps for a wide range of platforms, including Windows, macOS,
            Android, iOS, Linux, and routers. It also supports smart TVs, game consoles, and browser
            extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. The apps are designed with a clean, intuitive
            interface featuring a large one-tap Connect button and Smart Location to quickly choose
            the fastest server. ExpressVPN supports split tunneling (on most platforms), allowing you
            to route only selected apps through the VPN. On mobile, features like auto-connect on
            untrusted Wi-Fi, built-in widgets, and seamless reconnection improve usability. The Linux
            version is command-line based but recently added GUI support via browser extensions.
            Its dedicated router app enables VPN coverage for all devices on your network, even
            those that don’t support VPNs natively.

        ExpressVPN is available on a wide range of platforms including Windows, macOS, iOS,
        Android, Linux, and routers. It also supports smart TVs, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, game
        consoles, and offers browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. The user interface
        is clean and consistent across devices, featuring a prominent one-click connect button
        and a Smart Location feature that recommends the fastest nearby server. ExpressVPN also
        offers split tunneling (on Windows, Android, and routers), allowing you to choose which
        apps use the VPN and which access the internet directly. On mobile, it includes auto-
        connect on insecure Wi-Fi and widget support for quick access. The Linux version is
        command-line based but can be paired with browser extensions for a graphical interface.
        ExpressVPN also provides a dedicated router app, enabling VPN protection for all devices
        on your network—even those that don’t natively support VPNs.</p>
